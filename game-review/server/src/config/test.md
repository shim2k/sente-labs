# Build-Order Timeline  \n\n| Time  | Event | Comment |\n|-------|-------|---------|\n| 0:22  | 1st House | Standard 🆗 |\n| 1:17  | Gold Mining Camp | Enables early Royal Knight opening |\n| 4:00  | Feudal ‑ “Casernes Centrales” (School of Cav) | Meta French Feudal ≈ 2:40 → you were +80 s late |\n| 5:09  | 1st Blacksmith + Melee Atk I | Good sync with knight production |\n| 5:43  | 1st Stable | Only one until 12 min – slows knight mass |\n| 5:54  | Ranged Armor I | Pre-emptive vs Ott spear spam 👍 |\n| 6:55  | Archery Range (×2) | Switched to archers vs spears |\n| 7:30  | Wheelbarrow (11:30) | Very late; aim < 8 min |\n| 8:17  | Double-Broadaxe (Wood Fell I) |\n| 12:25 | Castle ‑ “Le Grande Université” (18:53) | ~5 min after optimal 1-TC timing |\n| 19:32 | Veteran Royal Knight upgrade |\n| 21:25 | Bloodlines |\n| 22:05 | Lumber Preservation (Wood III) |\n| 23:10 | Cantled Saddle |\n| 23:10 | First Trebuchet |\n\n# Economy Analysis  \n\n• Total gathered 41.8 k (Food 20.7k / Gold 11.2k / Wood 9.9k) – good overall mix.  \n• 19 s TC idle all game – excellent.  \n• Villager count: 78 by 28:30; but first 2 TC never added → you were only +2 vills over Ottomans at 20 min.  \n• Late eco techs hurt gather-rate:  \n  – Wheelbarrow @ 11:30 (690 s)  \n  – Fertilisation @ 20:14 (1214 s)  \n  – Lumber Pres. @ 22:05 (1325 s)  \n• Resource float spikes:  \n  – 19:00 (1140 s) banked 1.5k food / 2.3k gold → delayed extra stables and knight upgrades.  \n  – 23:00 (1380 s) still 2.4k food idle while wood was 0.5k; no farms/TC added.  \n• You never mined stone (0) → fine, but then spend excess food on more vills or farms.\n\n# Military & Tech Timing  \n\nMinute | Army & Tech\n-------|-------------\n5-10   | 6-8 Royal Knights (Vet not yet) with only Melee Atk I. Good for map picks, but you engaged spears without numbers.\n18:53  | Castle + immediate Veteran Knight (19:32) → power spike available.\n20:30  | Army 25 Knights + 18 Archers vs Ott 30 Jannisaries + 20 Spears + 2 Mangos – you lacked Siege Engineering.\n23:10  | Cantled Saddle + Bloodlines active, but knight count had already dropped to 9 because of the 22:50 mangonel wipe.\n26-29  | Single Treb + Knight/Arbaletrier mix closed the game once Bombard was sniped.\n\nTech gaps  \n• No Blacksmith armor II/III all game → knights melted to Janissary focus fire.  \n• Chivalry only @ 23:10 (1390 s); healing power came after big fights instead of before.\n\n# Map Control & Vision  \n\n• Only 1 scout; never replaced. After it died (not shown in log but LOS stagnated) you had zero eyes on Ottoman double-military-school push.  \n• Zero outposts/ walls – Ottoman spears walked into your wood line at 9:24 (564 s) and killed 3 vills.  \n• Relics: you ignored all five; Delhi picked 2 at 20:39 & 27:28, gifting them 600 g/min.  \n• First Trebuchet @ 23:10 let you finally pressure Ottoman landmark cluster and force the surrender.\n\n# Turning Points (Key Fights / Decisions)  \n\n1. 9:24 – 5 Knights dive Janissaries + 9 Spears. You lose 3 Knights (564 s) for only 4 Janis → tempo swing to Ott. Cause: no micro + no archer support yet.  \n2. 16:42 – Second knight raid (1002 s) collides with freshly upgraded Spearman II mass; 5 more Knights down. This delays Castle by ~2 min.  \n3. 22:48 – Double Mangonel volley (1368 s) deletes your 14 Archers behind Knights; army value –1.6 k instantly. You retreat but upgrades finish while regrouping.  \n4. 28:00 – Trebuchet + 12 Vet Knights focus Great Bombard (1606 s destroy). Ott resigns 2 min later; your macro finally translated to siege.\n\n# Biggest Improvement Areas 🔥  \n\n• Feudal timing +80 s → gave Ottomans uncontested map control early.  \n  Fix: Cut sheep greed; 6-sheep → 1-gold vill sooner, queue landmark by 2:35.  \n\n• Eco upgrades consistently late → ~10 % slower gather-rate (e.g., Wheelbarrow + Fertilisation).  \n  Fix: Hotkey an “eco tech” check every time you drop 150 f / 50 w. Aim Wheelbarrow before 8:00, Double-Broadaxe before 7:00.  \n\n• Floating >2 k food/gold during 18-23 min → translates to 0 DPS on field.  \n  Fix: Add 2nd–3rd Stable immediately on reaching 700 f/250 g bank; queue Knights in batches of 4.  \n\n• Insufficient scout & vision. No info on Mangonel timing → archers clumped.  \n  Fix: Train a 2nd scout post-Feudal; park him near Ottoman siege workshops.  \n\n• Tech layering: Armor upgrades skipped. Knights had 0/2 armor vs Janis 2 attack upgrades.  \n  Fix: Schedule Iron Undermesh II right after Castle (cost 100 f/150 g – affordable).\n\n# Tailored Practice Drills  \n\n1. “3:00 Feudal French” – Solo build: 13 vils food, 2 gold, drop School of Cav by 2:35; hit Feudal ≤ 3:00 ten times in a row.  \n2. “Resource-Drain Knight Spam” – Custom lobby vs easy AI; upon Castle, queue 3 stables & spend to <300 f/<100 g before 21 min. Repeat until consistent.  \n3. “Double-Scout Map Sweep” – Skirmish on random map; create 2 scouts, set waypoints to all relic & neutral sites; maintain 90 % unexplored cleared by 10 min.\n\nKeep sharpening, shim2k – tighten those early timings and your mid-game French snowball will be unstoppable! 💪
